requirement

create a user interface to exploit the created API
Format the information and functionalities available to allow a non-experienced user to 
generate compositions.

A website allows:
- to display composition details
- add shapes to a composition
- to save to modify the shapes present in the composition
- to display the areas and perimeters of this composition
- Communication with the API is minimized to limit the impact of your application on the environment.


front end

/view-list
show a list of compositions by name and id
when you click it, and press edit, go to edit url /edit, 

/edit
show the shapes of the composition in the canvas
when you click on a shape
the attributes of the shape will load
you can edit them
and press save button
you can edit the shapes, add shapes and save it

edit page also consists the ability to add shapes to the canvas
open an empty canvas
can create a compositions
add shapes to it
save it


tasks to do

done
create a canvas and add different shapes to it

done
add some shapes to db
show them in canvas
edit them
save them in db

done
get id of object
modify object

modify 2 objects



and retrieve them in the list

on object add - modify the shapes array
on object remove - modify the shapes array


types of shapes
rectangle
sqaure
triangle
circle



refresh the page 
add dialog



The objective is to create a web application using an API that allows you to manage 
different geometric shapes. The application and API are coded following the principles 
of Object Oriented Programming (OOP). This application will allow you to create
 and delete geometric shapes according to different characteristics,
 to create, save and share compositions, or even to contribute to an existing 
 composition or being created. This application must also display some mathematical
 characteristics of the composition (total area, total perimeter, etc.).














extend time for bug fix
feature development?

imports are wrong
models are not available
components are not imported correctly (standalone and ngmodule)
